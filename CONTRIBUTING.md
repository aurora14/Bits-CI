### Features and improvements

To suggest a bug fix, a feature, request help or inquire about any other improvements, open a new issue here. 

Code contributions can be made with pull requests. 

CI runs a test workflow for any PRs issued. Standard formats for feature and fix branches are feature/<feature_name>, fix/<fix_name> etc. When creating a PR simply assign @aurora14 as reviewer.
