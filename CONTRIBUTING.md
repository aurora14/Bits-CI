#  Contribution guide

### Features and improvements

There are two steps to contribute to this project.

Features are discussed in a Trello board. This is the first point of call, so you can see what's currenlty being worked on, what's planned, post your own suggestions and features, and enter any discussions. 

To request access to the trello board drop me a line here: 

animated_stardust_dev (at) gmx (dot) com

Code contributions can be made with pull requests. 

CI runs a test workflow for any PRs issued. Standard formats for feature and fix branches are feature/<feature_name>, fix/<fix_name> etc. When creating a PR simply assign @aurora14 as reviewer. 

### Issues

If you find something not working quite like you expect, please open an issue in GitHub. I will do my best to attend to it as quickly as it's possible. 

### Beta testing

There is a limited number of spots available for beta testing. Contact me on the same address as specified in Features and Improvements 
to get beta link.
