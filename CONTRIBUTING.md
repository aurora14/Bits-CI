#  Contribution guide

### Features and improvements

There are two steps to contribute to this project.

Features are discussed in a Trello board. This is the first point of call, so you can see what's currenlty being worked on, what's planned, post your own suggestions and features, and enter any discussions. 

To request access to the trello board drop me a line here: 

animated_stardust_dev (at) gmx (dot) com

Code contributions can be made with pull requests. 

### Issues

If you find something not working quite like you expect, please open an issue in GitHub. I will do my best to attend to it as quickly as it's possible.
