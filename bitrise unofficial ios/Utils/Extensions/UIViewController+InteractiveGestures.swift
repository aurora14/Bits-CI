  ///     for this property is `false`, which means the swipe gesture is "off" unless the user

  ///   - consumeSwitch: whether the recognizer should also consume the touch gesture or make it
  ///     available to other views. The default value is `true`, which means the touch gesture
  ///     will be consumed unless the user makes it explicitly available to other views.
